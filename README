"pdf2line" is a simple command-line utility to convert PDF into text.

It is based on "pdftotext" from the Xpdf suite, but with a different
layout algorithm that preserves relative column position and line spacing.

To use it for anything other than ASCII text, you'd need to have a
/usr/local/etc/xpdfrc or ~/.xpdfrc configured in a way that allows
Xpdf's "pdftotext" to run correctly for your purpose.
